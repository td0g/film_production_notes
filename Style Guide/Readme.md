#ff86b4 ![ff86b4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff86b4/000000?text=+)

### Transitions

If text is overlayed on video, use a **Cut** transition.

## Video Editing

### Transitions

The default transition is the **Cut** transition.  It should be used unless there is a specific reason for a more complex transition.

**Crossfades** can be used if necessary but generally should be avoided.  If used, keep it fast (0.5 seconds or less)

### Editing Segments

*In general, editing is done well when you get it looking just right, then back off 30% - 50%.*

Excessive silence or 'umms' can be cut occasionally, but more than two cuts can feel excessive and jerky.

Mild zooming on a frame can add interest, but excessive zooming can be distracting.
