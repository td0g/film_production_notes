# Editing with Shotcut

### First Things First

Get to know the style guide!!!

### Transitions

Shotcut has a number of transition effects.  The key is to keep it simple - avoid complex or dated transitions, and only use a transition effect if you have a good reason!

### Text

Shotcut has some quirks with text.  Here are some tips to make text look good

* Use the Text: Simple filter wherever possible.  The outline should be about 3px thick, black, alpha=120

* Stick to white or the three colours in the style guide

* Stick to the fonts prescribed in the style guide

* Generally, do not use transition effects for text.  The text-only segments are a special case and you can use some of the transitions prescribed in the style guide
