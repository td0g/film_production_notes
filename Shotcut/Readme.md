# Editing with Shotcut

### First Things First

Shotcut is available for free at [shotcut.org](https://shotcut.org/download/).  Please ensure you have the latest version!

Get to know the style guide!!!

Shotcut is Free Open Source Software (FOSS), and has some minor quirks.  Good practice is to save regularly, and if the Shotcut is acting odd then try closing and reopening it.

## Media (Video or Audio)

### Importing

Before importing media, make sure you have a place to put it!  Add a video or audio track by clicking the hamburger near the bottom left.

To add media, drag and drop the clip onto the preview screen.  You'll note the tab on the bottom left of the preview screen switches to 'Source'.  Then you can drag and drop the preview screen onto the desired track.  The tab on the bottom left of the preview screen will switch back to 'Project'.

### Trimming and Moving

The clip can be trimmed by dragging either end of the clip, or by selecting the **Track** that the media is on, moving the **Playhead** to the position where you want to trim the clip, then pressing **S** or clicking **Split at Playhead**, and finally deleting the portion of the cilp you do not want.

Clips can be moved by dragging and dropping.  Note that clips cannot 'leapfrog' over another clip on the same **Track**, you must move it to a different **Track** to get around a clip.

### Editing Control Buttons

Just above the timeline, there are a series of toggle buttons that control how the timeline behaves when clips are trimmed or moved.

**Toggle Snapping**: Clips will snap to the playhead (preferred) or to the nearest clip beginning or end on any **Track**.  Toggle this off to turn off Snapping.

**Scrub While Dragging**: The playhead will move when clips are moved

**Ripple Trim And Drop**: If a clip is moved or trimmed, all clips to the right will be moved.  This is useful if you want to edit a clip but want to maintain timing on all the rest of the clips.

**Ripple Edits Across All Tracks**: Same as above, but affects ALL **Tracks** instead of just the one you are editing.

## Adding Effects

### Transitions

Shotcut has a number of transition effects.  The key is to keep it simple - avoid complex or dated transitions, and only use a transition effect if you have a good reason!

### Text

Shotcut has some quirks with text.  Here are some tips to make text look good

* Use the Text: Simple filter wherever possible.  The outline should be about 3px thick, black, alpha=120

* Stick to white or the three colours in the style guide

* Stick to the fonts prescribed in the style guide

* Generally, do not use transition effects for text.  The text-only segments are a special case and you can use some of the transitions prescribed in the style guide
