# Process

## Equipment Setup

### Lighting

There are three types of lighting used in our studio: Ambient lighting (the overhead lights), key/fill lighting (the softboxes), and targeted lighting (various lamps).  We try to avoid separate key/fill lights, just keep it simple for the interview look.

* **Light Colour**: Make sure the temperature of all lights are the same!

### Camera

Following is a checklist for using **Canon DSLR's** for video recording.  Other types of cameras should try to use the same or similar settings.

* **White Balance**: Use Tungsten.  DO NOT USE Auto WB.
* **Quality**: Use 1080p @ 30 fps.  If this is not available then use 720 @ 30 fps.  DO NOT USE 24 fps.
* **Exposure**: Use manual exposure settings - set the aperture / shutter speed, and turn off Auto ISO!  Use the largest aperture available (F/2.8 recommended).  The shutter speed should be the slowest possible (1/30 if recording at 30 fps).  Limit your ISO (on a t5i or 7D, keep the ISO below 800).
* **Style**: Use the Standard recording style.
* **Framing**: If multiple interviews are being filmed, do not adjust the framing after the first interviewee.  Instead adjust the seat to frame the interviewee.  Frame the shot with this in mind.

## Filming

### Camera Checklist

1) Framing - Is the interviewee being clipped?  Is the backdrop well framed?

### Starting WITH Sound Technician

1) The **sound technician** is responsible for coordinating the start of the recording
1) When everyone is ready, the sound technician will announce something to the effect of '**Recording Start**'.  The audio and video recordings will begin **immediately AFTER** the announcement.
1) The sound technician will play a tone to synchronize the audio and video.  Everyone must be **silent until the tone is sounded**.  The tone should be sounded 1 - 5 seconds after the 'Recording Start' announcement.
