## Equipment Setup

### Lighting

There are three types of lighting used in our studio: Ambient lighting (the overhead lights), key/fill lighting (the softboxes), and targeted lighting (various lamps).  We try to avoid different key/fill lights, just keep it simple for the interview look.

* **Light Colour**: Make sure the temperature of all lights are the same!
